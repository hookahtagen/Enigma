Enigma Machine Simulator

## Description
This is a simple enigma machine simulator. It can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.<br>
The machine uses rotors, which could be chosen from a list of rotors, or randomly selected.<br>
You can also choose the reflector and the plugboard, and provide an initial rotor offset.

### Alread implemented
General:
    + Enciphering messages <br>
    + Choosing rotors from a list<br>
    + Choosing the number of rotors<br>
    + Choosing the reflector <br>
    + Choosing the plugboard<br>
    + Choosing the initial rotor offset<br>
    + Choosing the message to be enciphered or deciphered<br>
    + Getting the notches of the rotors (for the rotor turnover)<br>
    
Special:
    - Creating a set of random rotors and save it to a txt file<br>

### Planned
General:
    - Deciphering messages<br>
