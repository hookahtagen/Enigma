Enigma Machine Simulator

## Description
This is a simple enigma machine simulator. It can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
The machine uses rotors, which could be chosen from a list of rotors, or randomly selected.
You can also choose the reflector and the plugboard, and provide an initial rotor offset.

### Alread implemented
General:
    - Enciphering messages <br>
    - Choosing rotors from a list
    - Choosing the number of rotors
    - Choosing the reflector 
    - Choosing the plugboard
    - Choosing the initial rotor offset
    - Choosing the message to be enciphered or deciphered
    - Getting the notches of the rotors (for the rotor turnover)
    
Special:
    - Creating a set of random rotors and save it to a txt file

### Planned
General:
    - Deciphering messages
